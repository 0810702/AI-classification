# AI-classification
ML and DL for classification
This is a brief introduction to perform machine learning and deep learning method for classification with numpy.

I provide 3 machine learning method (least square method, logictics regression, support vector machine), and 2 deep learning method (DNN, CNN) to implement classification

The whole code is in Classification.ipynb. And I have seperated the individual method into several class file, so is the function for loading dataset and data preprocessing.
